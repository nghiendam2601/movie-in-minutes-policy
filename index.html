  <p><Strong>Effective Date:</Strong> May 15, 2025<br><Strong>Developer:</Strong> Nghien Dam Minh<br><Strong>Contact Email:</Strong> nghiendm@gmail.com</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the “Movie In Minutes” mobile application (“App”), developed by Nghien Dam Minh as a free service. This App is provided <Strong>“as is”</Strong> and is intended for entertainment purposes only.
</p>
  <h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>
  <p>• We do not use analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics).</p>
	<p>• We do not collect your device ID, IP address, location, or browsing history.</p>
	<p>• Your interactions within the App are anonymous and stay entirely on-device.</p>
  <h3>2. Use of Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>The App integrates with the following <Strong>third-party services</Strong> to provide core functionality:</p>
  <p><Strong>• <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy">The Movie Database (TMDB) Privacy Policy</a></Strong>: The app uses the TMDb API to retrieve and display publicly available metadata about movies and TV shows, such as titles, posters, ratings, and descriptions. TMDb account authentication (if initiated by the user) is handled securely via Safari using OAuth, and no authentication credentials or sensitive data are stored or processed by us.</p>
  <p><Strong>• <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">YouTube / Google Privacy Policy</a></Strong>: The app uses the YouTube Data API to display, search and play official trailers related to movies and TV content. All playback is handled using the embedded YouTube player or, when necessary, redirected to the official YouTube app via URL scheme. We do not download, store, or alter any video content. We do not store login credentials or track user data indefinitely, in compliance with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service">YouTube API Services Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies">YouTube Developer Policies</a>.</p>
  <p>These third parties may collect information <Strong>in accordance with their own privacy policies</Strong>, not controlled or accessed by us.</p>
  <h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
  <p>We <Strong>do not store any data</Strong> on our servers. All data such as your TMDb lists and reviews are stored by TMDb under your own TMDb account.</p>
  <p>You can clear any local app data by uninstalling the App.</p>
  <h3>4. Children’s Privacy</h3>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe your child has provided any data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
  <h3>5. Security</h3>
  <p>While the App does not process personal data, we take the following security measures to protect all interactions:</p>
	<p>• All communication with TMDb and YouTube APIs is transmitted using SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS).</p>
	<p>• We do not log or transmit sensitive data.</p>
	<p>• The App runs in a secure iOS sandbox environment and does not access background location, contacts, photos, microphone, or other sensitive device permissions.</p>
  <p>In short, even though we do not collect personal data, we maintain a privacy-first approach by following security best practices throughout the App’s design.</p>
  <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the changes.</p>
